Ammeter
### Overview

This project implements a digital ammeter on STM32 microcontrollers. It is designed as a portable and extensible embedded firmware platform for measuring electrical current using external analog front-end circuitry and the on-chip ADC peripherals of supported MCUs.

The firmware focuses on accuracy, modularity, and portability across STM32 families, with a clear separation between hardware abstraction, signal acquisition, and application-level logic.

### Supported Microcontrollers

The project currently supports the following MCUs:
- STM32F429ZIT (STM32F4 series)
- STM32G431C6TX (STM32G4 series)

Support for additional STM32 devices can be added by extending the hardware abstraction and BSP layers.
